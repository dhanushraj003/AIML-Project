The "Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning" project aims to
develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a
particular disease based on various health-related features. The system will
utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data and make
predictions, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare
management.
